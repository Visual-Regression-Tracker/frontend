## Local setup

- clone repo
- `npm i`
- Update `.env`
- `npm run start`

The testing related `.spec.tsx` files are used with Cypress for browser tests, and the `.test.tsx` files with Jest for unit tests.

## Image download
 
 - If you want to use image download feature in test runs, you have to have the files in backend imageUploads folder to a folder in this project under public/static/imageUploads. This can be achieved via manual copy, docker volume mapping to this project folder etc.

## Local HTTPS config

- Generate keys [here](https://www.selfsignedcertificate.com/)
- place in folder `/secrets` named `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key`
